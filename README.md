# CODEX-Pre-Qualification-Test

This repository was created to display my exercises resolutions as proposed in the CODEX SummerIntership Pre qualification program. In this repo I will try to show some of my skills and known methodologies while solving the proposed problems.

## About the Challenge

This challenge consist of 8 exercises that are intended to be done in a week of work. Each exercise seems to cover a different skill and therefore will be resolved in a specific way. This will allow me to try and show different skills that better suits the problem.

## About the Folder Structure and Git Work Flow

In order to better organize the presentation of my work, each exercise will be placed in a single folder. All folders will be created in advance since some exercises can be left blank if they are not solved in time. Each folder will also have a README file specific for the problem in order to further describe the resolution and give more implementations details

Also, I will be using a specific git workflow that I choose for this challenge. Each exercise will have a dev branch (Ex: Dev-Ex1) this will be done in order to divide unstable code (work in progress) from stable one that will be placed in the main branch. And will also help me focus my attention to a single exercise at a time, since one branch will not have code of another one.
