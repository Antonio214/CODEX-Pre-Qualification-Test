# Rectangles That Intersect

## About the Problem

Considering two rectangles in a discrete grid (like pixels in a display), each defined by two points, return true if they intersect, false otherwise.

**Note**: the points are included in the rectangle and have a dimension of 1 unit, the rectangle (0,0;1,1) have an area of 4 units.
