# To-Do for Rectangles that Intersect

- [ x ] Return "NÃ£o intersectam" for 2 rectangles that have no point in common
- [ x ] Return "Intersectam" for 2 equal rectangles
- [ x ] Return "Intersectam" for 2 rectangles with same edge points
- [ x ] Return "Intersectam" for 2 rectangles that share any commom points
- [] Add a CLI to project for user to interact

## Side notes

- If two rectangles intersect that means an edge point of rectB is inside rectA or is equal to an edge point of rectA
- Rect Notation -> (x1,y1;x2,y2)
- Point notation -> x1,y1

## Future Ideas:

- [] Validate User Imput
- [] Maybe add some GUI to project
