# CNPJ Validator

## About the Problem

Given a string, check if it looks like a CNPJ, considering two formats: Formatted and Number Only.
Also, validate if it's a well-formed CNPJ, considering the "check digits", as defined by Receita Federal in [here](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastro_Nacional_da_Pessoa_Jur%C3%ADdica).
